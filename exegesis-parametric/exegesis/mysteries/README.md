# CPU Mysteries

This directory lists some interesting things we've discovered while playing with
CPUs. This includes measurements or behaviors that we cannot currently explain.

For every case, we'll try to provide as much information as possible, including
code to reproduce and possible explanations.

To run an experiment, just pass its directory as make target, e.g.:

```
  make read_modify_write
```
